Train the TensorFlow model with the training data.**\n","\n","* The EfficientDet-Lite0 model uses `epochs = 50` by default, which means it will go through the training dataset 50 times. You can look at the validation accuracy during training and stop early to avoid overfitting.\n","* Set `batch_size = 8` here so you will see that it takes 21 steps to go through the 175 images in the training dataset.\n","* Set `train_whole_model=True` to fine-tune the whole model instead of just training the head layer to improve accuracy.
